# A Contrastive Explanation Service for Plans in Hybrid Domains
<br>
This project proposes a novel approach for generating optimal
plans by automating and iteratively generating Hypothetical
models. The proposed approach consists of three main steps:
(1) the automation of Hmodel generation, (2) the use of an
iterative model to obtain an optimal plan, and (3) the use of
both automation and iterative Hmodel generation to indepen-
dently generate an optimal plan, regardless of the userâ€™s input.
The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated
through experiments and results show that it can outperform
existing approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
This paper contributes to the field of automated planning and
scheduling by providing a new and effective approach for de-
signing XAIP as a web service.
